        <ul><b>Frame data for attacks out of shield are calculated as follows:</b>
            <li>Up-B, U-Smash can be used immediately out of shield. </li>
            <li>Aerials add a 3 frame jumpsquat to the startup (can jump immediately out of shield).</li>										
            <li>Grabs out of shield add 4 frames to startup.</li>
            <li>Dash attacks add 11 frames required to drop shield and an extra 1 frame to begin the dash.</li>												
            <li>All other options add 11 frames needed to drop shield to startup.</li>
        </ul>
        Use the site to see what moves you can use to punish an opponent's move that hit your shield. <br>
        Also, you can see which of your moves are unpunishable or only lightly punishable by your opponent on shield. <br>

        <b>Warning: Even though a move can punish a blocked attack based on frame data, it's possible  <br>
        that the spacing makes the attack unpunishable through whiffing or being too far away. </b>

        <br><br>
        <b>F.A.Q.</b><br>
        <i>What moves are considered punishable?</i> <br>
        A move on shield is listed as punishable <br> by a move out of shield
        if the least negative <br> frame disadvantage is still enough for the <br>
        out of shield option to start (the negative <br> number is bigger than
        the positive number). <br>In other words, if you can hit the opponent <br>
        with the move while they are still in lag from the attack. <br> <br>
        <i>What is 'Rapid Finisher'?</i> <br>
        The rapid finisher of a jab. <br> <br>
        <i>Aren't there some missing out of shield options? </i><br>
        Aerial specials and specials after dropping <br> shield are not included,
        to simplify options <br> and due to difficulty labeling the many special moves, sorry :( <br> <br>
        <i>What out of shield options are included?</i> <br>
        All aerials, smash attacks, tilts, z-airs, grab, and up specials. <br> <br>
        <i>Are there some missing attacks on shield?</i> <br>
        Attacks that put you in free fall like Mario's <br>Up-B are not covered,
        as you can generally <br> use your imagination to punish :)
